# Cosplan
Cosplan is an Android application that help users manage their future plans, including long-term plans, short-term plans and Calendar for events.  Setting up proper plans makes everyone work more efficiently and live a full life.  I started to create this application in order to help me manage my life and time as well as to learn Android Studio.
